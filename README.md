# TaskScheduler

This project is a Task Scheduler developed in C, created as a practical assignment for the Operating Systems course in the 5th semester of the Bachelor's program. The goal of this project is to simulate task scheduling on multiple processors, including handling task priorities, managing idle and faulty processors, and sorting tasks based on specific criteria.
